# all-type-of-bisection-math-solution
this program lets you create  solutions to any kind of bisection math problem. To find out a solution to a problem you have to give the input directly through the code itself. i didn't spend much time on this project thus there are some silly mistakes in the code but fear not you wont get any wrong output as long as you are giving a proper input. to use this project you might need a little bit knowledge in c .and a codeblocks or any equivalent ide or online c compiler.
